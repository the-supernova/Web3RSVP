>You must set up your blockchain wallet to use this application. Follow the instructions below to set up your wallet.

# Set Up Your Wallet

## Download Coinbase Wallet
Note: If you already have a crypto wallet like MetaMask that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain, you may skip setting up Coinbase Wallet.

You will need Chrome browser for this setup. Download the browser [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/).

1. **Download the Coinbase Wallet Chrome extension**. You can find the link [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coinbase-wallet-extension/hnfanknocfeofbddgcijnmhnfnkdnaad?hl=en).

2. Upon downloading the extension, a new tab should open where you'll be guided through the wallet creation process. Be sure to select **Create a new wallet** and then follow the prompts.

3. You should **write down your recovery phrase** and keep it safe as best practice, but if you lose this wallet, nothing will happen because this is strictly a _development_ wallet.

4. Once you've created your wallet, click on the puzzle piece icon at the top right of your Chrome browser search bar. Pin the extension to your toolbar by clicking on the pin icon.

5. Click on the Coinbase Wallet extension icon to interact with your wallet. Click the Settings icon and then click on "Default network".

6. Scroll down the list of networks until you see the option to **Enable testnets**. Toggle **Enable testnets** to be **ON**.

7. Enabling testnets should have expanded the list of networks. Scroll down the list of _Testnets_ to find **Polygon Mumbai**. Select **Polygon Mumbai** as your default network.
